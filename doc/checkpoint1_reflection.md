# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
I implemented my controller intialization on the controller class in order for it to be
run in void setup() when the program starts. I also started on the constructors of each class
but I am still looking to redefine and tighten it up, especially since I am still trying to get
familiar with the XInput Library as it is the most important library used for controller
to communicate with the computer.
On the side, I also spent a good amount of time setting up the firmware and soldering the parts together
onto the PCB. The firmware pieces are now ready for backend implementation, program can be uplaoded once 
it is complete. 

## Challenges I Faced
I am following a tutorial on how to program an Arduino gaming controller using C++, not only
does the guy use a different IDE but he also is not utilizing object-oriented programming and is simply
just using the XInput library by itself. 
My struggle with this project is that I am not familiar with the XInput library and I am not sure how to
implement it into my code. I am seeing myself deleting some functions and rewriting certain members as I am 
learning more about the library and how it works. I think it is especially hard for me to code this while utilizing
objetc-oriented programming, especially since most of the tutorials and guides I've seen online do not
use it.

## What I Learned
I learned a lot about XInput and how to use it in my code. I also learned that the main.cpp file is formatted different
than the rest of the files I've seen in other projects we have worked on. Unlike the typical main.cpp file with a int main() member,
my main.cpp file has a void setup() and void loop() member that is unique in order to run it on my Arduino. I'm slowly learning how to
implement object-oriented programming into Arduino-style code and how to implement it with the XInput library.

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
I will definitely talk about it with you in person but:
1. I would need more guidance on how to implement object-oriented programming into my code.
2. Running tests? Not sure how that would apply to my project, most of the testing would be conducted once everything is complete and the program is uploaded onto
the Arduino. I would just keep testing it and rewriting it until it works.
   
   ...(I'm not sure if I'm asking too much, I'm just trying to be as clear as possible. I am super behind and I apologize, I just wanted to submit something.
I am working hard to make sure this works!)

## Time Spent
Approximately 8 hours (4 hours spent on firmware soldering, rest on learning XInput and coding)
